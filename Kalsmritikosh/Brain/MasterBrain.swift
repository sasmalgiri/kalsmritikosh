//  MasterBrain.swift
//  Kalsmritikosh
//
//  Final orchestrator. Detects intent, routes (capabilities + experts +
//  retrieval layers + parallelism), fans out work in parallel, verifies
//  findings, emits an answer with citations.
//
//  Hard rules:
//  - Holds no FileManager / URL.
//  - Holds no specific ModelProvider. Resolves capabilities through
//    CapabilityRegistry — the only entry point any caller uses to obtain
//    a model.
